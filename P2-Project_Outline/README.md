For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a lesson scheduler. This app will allow admin-user to display their availability and enable users to select and confirm their lesson time for the week/month. 

This idea came about from my personal experience as a music teacher: students who do not want regularly scheduled weekly lessons usually will send me a text to check on my availability and then we have a back and forth to figure out a mutually agreeable time. There are apps like this on the market that have the scheduling capabilities(eg. Music Teacher Helper) but they also has a lot of other features that I do not need such as invoicing/earning reports, student progress reports etc. There's a monthly subscription fee that I do not think is feasible for a smaller part-time music studios like mine.   

### Features
1) Admin's available lesson time slots will be displayed
2) Users can log in and select/request available time slots
3) Admin can confirm requests and a confirmation email will be sent to user.
4) Users' profile will be tracked and kept as a student record in MySQL. Users can edit/update information.
5) Admin has access to adding/deleting users

### Technologies
1) Java/Spring Boot
2) JavaScript/TypeScript/Angular
3) MySQL or mongoDB (still undecided)
4) Google Calendar API

### What I'll Have to Learn
1) integration of Angular and Spring Boot
2) Using Google Calendar API
