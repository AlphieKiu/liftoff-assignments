## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a lesson scheduler. This app will allow admin-user to display their availability and enable users to select and confirm their lesson time for the week/month. 

This idea came about from my personal experience: students who do not want regularly scheduled weekly lessons usually will send me a text to check on my availability and then we have a back and forth to figure out a mutually agreeable time. There are apps like this on the market that have the scheduling capabilities but also has a lot of other features that I do not need such as invoicing/earning reports, student progress reports etc. There's also a monthly subscription fee that I do not think is feasible for a small part-time music studio like mine.   

### Features
1) Admin's available lesson time slots will be shown
2) Users can log in and select available time slots
3) Users profile will be tracked and kept as a student record. Users can edit/update information.
